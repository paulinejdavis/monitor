## Summary

An application that tracks a large number (hundreds) of sources, many of which don't publish new content frequently and traditionally takes a long time to verify each source individually by hand. 

This tool is able to take an arbitrary number of urls as an input and check that (for instance) each url is reachable and returns valid content. By periodically run this tool would allow some basic checks on less frequently updated sources(urls).
